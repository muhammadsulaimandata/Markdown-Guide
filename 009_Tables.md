# Tables
--- 

We can create tables using the pipe (|) symbol and it'll be working like the wall of table. 
Example\
| Specie | Petal_Length | Sepal_Length |
|------- | ------------ | ------------ |
|virginica| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |

This is how tables are made.\
We can also do the alignment of content as well in table by using the double colon (:) symbol with the dashes to which side we want and for middle alignment we have to put double colon to both sides of dashes like this
| Specie | Petal_Length | Sepal_Length |
|-------: | :------------: | ------------: |
|virginica| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |

The above is just a raw example but, we can do alot more with help of this with respect to alignment.
