# Line Breaks
We can give line breaks in two methods
## Method 1
We can give a line space with pressing enter at end of line, and here you'll notice the space is more, and it should be prefered when using between two paragraphs.

This is my dummuy text.

This is my dummuy text part 2.

## Method 2

# 3-Face of Text

Face of text include following things
>Bold\
>Italic\
>Bold and Italic

For making text Bold, put text inside double asterisk each side
**Bold Text**\
For Making Text Italic, put text inside one asterisk each side
*Italic Text*\
For making text both Italic and Bold, put three asterisk arround the text each side\
***Bold and Italic Text***


Instead of using asterisk symbol, you can also use this symbols as well
>_ (Underscore)

And it's method of usage is same as for asterisk, like now for underscore
__Bold__, _Italic_, ___Bold and Italic___

# 7-Images and Figures with link

## Importing Image

[Image](mkd.png).

But when we put ! this sign before Image word, then it become the image like this

![Image](mkd.png)

## Online Pictures
We can also put online pictures here as well, and it's method is same for above

[OnlineImage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Markdown-mark.svg)

# 8-Code Blocks
Code can be put inside the text in this way.\
This is how we print string `print("Hello World")`

But also we can do this in a separate block as well, which is like this
```
print("Hello World!")
print("This is my first code")
print("Learning Markdown")
print("Hi! I'm a Data Analyst")
```

# 9-Tables
--- 

We can create tables using the pipe (|) symbol and it'll be working like the wall of table. 
Example\
| Specie | Petal_Length | Sepal_Length |
|------- | ------------ | ------------ |
|virginica| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |

This is how tables are made.\
We can also do the alignment of content as well in table by using the double colon (:) symbol with the dashes to which side we want and for middle alignment we have to put double colon to both sides of dashes like this
| Specie | Petal_Length | Sepal_Length |
|-------: | :------------: | ------------: |
|virginica| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|setosa| 18.5 | 19.0 |
|versicolor| 18.5 | 19.0 |

The above is just a raw example but, we can do alot more with help of this with respect to alignment.
