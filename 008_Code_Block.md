# Code Blocks
Code can be put inside the text in this way.\
This is how we print string `print("Hello World")`

But also we can do this in a separate block as well, which is like this
```
print("Hello World!")
print("This is my first code")
print("Learning Markdown")
print("Hi! I'm a Data Analyst")
```
